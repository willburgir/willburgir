## 🚀 Projects

### PortfolioBuilder Program
One of my current projects involves implementing concepts from Modern Portfolio Theory. The PortfolioBuilder program computes the optimal portfolio composition given a list of asset classes and a risk-free rate. I am excited about the potential of this software to improve how I manage my own assets.

### Mobile Development with Kotlin
I also have hands-on experience in mobile development using Kotlin and Android Studio. Check out my projects in this space to see how I'm bringing ideas to life on the mobile platform.

### Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing
Dabbling in DuckyScript for cybersecurity and penetration testing, I'm always intrigued by the ever-evolving landscape of digital security.
